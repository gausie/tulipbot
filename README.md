Hello! This is `tulipbot`, a (probably) short-lived bot by **gausie (#1197090)** to make sure you get a good deal on your ttttulips. Here is how the bot is used:

Just run `/msg tulipbot <command>`, picking from one of the commands below

| Command | Function |
| ----- | ----- |
| `balance` | See your tulip and Chroner balance |
| `prices` | See current prices |
| `sell [@ <min>]` | Set your minimum tulip sell price to `<min>`. No `<min>` will tell you your current sell price |
| `buy [<quantity>|*] <item name>` | Buy `<item name>` with your Chroner balance. If no `<quantity>` is specified, it'll buy 1. `*` will buy as many as possible with your balance. |
| `help` | See something like this usage guide in except in your kmail inbox |

To add to your balance, send tulips via kmail. Do not send in gift packages - it doesn't know how to open them. Roses can be converted to round your balance. Please note though that roses are converted to Chroner 2:1 and as such any odd numbers of roses sent will be considered a 1-rose donation.
